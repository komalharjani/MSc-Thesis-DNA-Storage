# MSc Dissertation @ University of St Andrews CS

Information storage has consistently been exponentially growing. Storage of digital information relies heavily on silicon, which is expected to run out in 2040. Current storage technologies also begin to deteriorate within 10 to 20 years, and have serious limitations to climate change. There is a pressing need for an alternative. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is an attractive solution, and has all the physical properties to supersede conventional technologies. It is estimated that DNA storage would allow for all of the world’s current storage to fit inside a shoebox, with no energy. Therefore, moving away from storing data in binary to storing data in DNA’s four-bases A, G, C, T, may have the ability to transform data storage as we know it. Although DNA has huge potential as a data storage device, there are multiple issues that need to be overcome before the adoption of this technology. These issues include exorbitant costs and extremely slow reading and writing times, and the production of errors by reading and writing processes of DNA. This study presents DNA Simulated Storage, a low cost software that is built with the purpose of testing encoding and error correcting schemes for DNA storage, there are usually extremely costly. Some success have been achieved with DNASS, in creating a customisable error simulator and in developing in an algorithm that is able to overcome deletion errors at comparable rates to previous works.

## Prerequisites
The front-ends are meant to run in any web browser. They makes use of standard ES6 functionality and are compliant with all newer versions of modern browsers (Chrome).
The server requires node.js. It was developed using node v8.9.4. It should be compatible with all versions of node that support ES6.
For a full list of all required packages please refer to "package.json".

## Instructions to run
The HTML page can be run in a browser.
